# self-driving-car
implemented a simple neural network from scratch.


made with the help of @gniziemazity's amazing tutorial on youtube! \
Made a simple driving game using HTML, CSS and Javascript and implemented a simple neural network, \
from scratch, without any libraries which learns to play the game itself (drive the car). \
Working on this project helped brushing up on javascript, as well as learning new stuff like applications of LERP,\
JSON etc.\
